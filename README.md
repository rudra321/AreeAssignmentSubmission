Problem statement

Look at the Whatsapp group messaging on your phone. Imagine you are creating just the WhatsApp Group Chat feature. As a solution to this problem, you are supposed to solve the following two sub-problems.

1. Create a Schema Design to store WhatsApp Group Messages. (Low-level design ofWhatsApp group messages). Feel free to base this schema on any SQL/NoSQL database.

2. Write a simple server-side application using NodeJS (You may use Javascript or Typescript as language). This application should run a simple HTTP server on port 3000 	and should contain the following API -

	a. API to load all the group messages in a paginated manner.
	b. API to create a message in the group (post a message in the group chat)
	
Feel free to use any NodeJS framework, ORM or NPM Libraries of your choice.
